This example program is part of the presentation, Dynamic Code Generation
with LLVM, given by Jeff Cohen on Dec 12, 2018, at the Bay Area ACCU meetup.

It has been released into the public domain.  Do with it as you like.

The home page of the LLVM project can be found at:

    http://llvm.org

There are dozens of documents covering numerous topics, but the following
three are a good place to begin:

    https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html
    https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html
    https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html

The last one is the home page for the Kaliedoscope tutorial.  One of its
sections covers the JIT (though at the time of this writing, it claims to
be out of date and will remain so until API churning comes to a conclusion).

While the above is still relevant for LLVM 7.0, a new API is under development
for a future release.  It will not be backwards compatible.  The following
video from the 2018 dev meeting covers ORCv2:

And finally, the calc example program is located here:

    https://github.com/jeffc768/llvm-jit-example.git 

To build, the environment variable USE_LLVM must point to the llvm-config
program.  Run Debug/calc.  It has two options, --printIR and --opt.
